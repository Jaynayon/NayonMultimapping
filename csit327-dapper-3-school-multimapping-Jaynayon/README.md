# CSIT327 3.2 School DB Multimapping üè´ü§Ø

## Task
1. Run `SchoolDb.sql` to your local database. 
It will create an `Exer3Db` database with a `School`, `College`, and `Department` Table.

![Database Diagram](DatabaseDiagram.png)

2. Add/create necessary models and properties for `School`, `College`, and `Department` models.
3. Implement `ISchoolRepository` _**ASYNCHRONOUSLY**_.
	 - `Get(id)` - Returns single school with Id == id
	 - `GetAll()` - Returns all schools
	 - These methods should only use ONE sql statement and Query each call. **NO MULTIPLE QUERY CALLS**.
	 - Should utilize Dapper multimapping capabilities.

4. `Program.cs` `Main` method already configured for testing and submission. Do not modify.

## Model format when printed in console
		
```json
[
    {
        "Id": 1,
        "Name" : "SchoolName1",
        "Address" : "SchoolAddress1",
        "Motto" : "SchoolMotto1",
        "AverageTuition" : 1,
        "Colleges" : [
            {
                "Id": 1,
                "Name" : "CollegeName1",
                "Dean" : "CollegeDean1",
                "Theme" : "CollegeTheme1",
                "Departments" : [
                    {
                        "Id": 1,
                        "Name" : "DepartmentName1",
                        "Chair" : "DepartmentChair1"
                    },
                    {
                        "Id": 2,
                        "Name" : "DepartmentName2",
                        "Chair" : "DepartmentChair2"
                    }
                    // ... more departments under this college1
                ]
            }
            // ... more colleges under this school1
        ]
    }
    // ... more schools
]
